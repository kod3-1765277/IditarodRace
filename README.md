# Iditarod Race Route Geonarrative
A Geonarrative for the 2021 Iditarod Race

## Description
This project is designed to provide a geonarrative of the 2021 Iditarod Race.
The project is a website which includes the history, general information, and race routes of the Iditarod race. In the map of this geonarrative, the race routes for different years (odd and even) are displayed, and the special COVID route for this year is also shown.
Responsive designs are included in the website, allowing for the sections of the websites to be scalable for smaller screens. The website is also scrollable, as it uses sections instead of different pages.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to inform a curious audience on the history and nature of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race. It is a major part of Alasakan culture and highlights the important role dog sleds played in the past as a means of traversing the extremely challenging terrain in the state.

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank Landon Reed and Morgan Herlocker for their willingness to share their Iditarod route and checkpoints geojson files on their GitHub repository publicly. Their data was essential in creating the webmap for the geonarrative. We would also like to thank the Iditarod website for maintaining their list of checkpoints and coordinates to the checkpoints so well.

We would also like to thank Start Bootstrap for making the [Grayscale Template](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale) available for free, public use.

Technical issues caused by conflicts between Bootstrap and Leaflet were resolved thanks to a [GIS StackExchange Forum](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/62491/sizing-leaflet-map-inside-bootstrap).
